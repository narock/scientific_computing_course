    "#### 1.) We need to launch our cannon ball a distance of 70 meters. We'll be launching from an angle of 40 degrees and an initial height of 1.5 meters. Our time interval will be 0.1 seconds. However, we don't know what initial velocity will get us to our desired distance of 70 meters. We don't want to randomly try values. Instead, we'd like to ask Python to start at 10 m/s and increment by 0.25 m/s until it finds an initial velocity that will get the cannon ball to the desired distance. Modify the program to do this. Print out the initial velocity value we should use (10 points)"
