    "We'll compare Linear Search to Binary Search. Linear Search is what's called a \"brute force\" algorithm. We simply look at every value until we find the one we're looking for. For example, let's say we have the numbers 1 through 10. I pick a number and ask you to guess which number I picked. Searching for my number by linear search, you'd guess 1, if that wasn't correct you'd then guess 2, and so on until you guessed the number I picked. Binary search, on the other hand, divides the search space into two equal parts - this is where the \"binary\" in the name comes from. It then eliminates one of those parts based on on information about the value we're looking for. For example, you might ask \"Is you number greater than or equal to 5?\". My answer would allow you to eliminate half of possible numbers. Binary search repeats this process until it finds the correct answer - each time eliminating half of the values. "

It tells us how fast the algorithm ran on your computer, but doesn't say much about how fast it'll run on my computer - or on a supercomputer.

    "8.) Our visualization is showing us that binary search is a \"better\" way to search because it has less time complexity. As n increases the Binary Search line is always well below the Linear search line in our plot. However, we don't always use binary search when implementing search. For example, many of the Python library functions that use search are build using linear search. Why? If binary search is so much better, why do you think it isn't always used? Look back over our implementations of linear and binary search. Binary search has a pre-condition that must be met in order for this algorithm to be used. What is it?
