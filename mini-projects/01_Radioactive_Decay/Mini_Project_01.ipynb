    "#### A radioactive isotope is an atom that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy causes the atom to breakdown in a process called radioactive decay. For more information see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide).\n",

    "#### If we have a sample of radioactive isotopes, the \"radioactive half-life\" is the time it takes for half the atoms in the sample to decay. \"Radioactive half-life\" is often shortened to just \"half-life\". After two half-lives, there will be one fourth the original sample, after three half-lives one eigth the original sample, and so forth. For example: \n",

    "Different elements have different half-lives. For example, the half-life of uranium-238 is 4.5 billion years. The half-life of plutonium-239 is 24,100 years and the half-life of thallium-201 is 73.1 hours. Given a container of thallium-201, half of the atoms will decay in 73.1 hours. Given a same size container of uranium-238, it will take 4.5 billion years before half the atoms decay.\n",

    "The half-life of an element doesn't change. However, which atoms in the container actually decay is a truly random process. For any given atom, there is a probability of decay. The probability of decay is given by a constant times the time step. For example, element X has a decay rate, alpha, of 0.01 s<sup>-1</sup>. The probability of a particular atom decaying in 1 second is: probability = 0.01 * 1 = 0.01\n",
