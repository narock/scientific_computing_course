    "1.) Financial planners often use Monte Carlo simulations to model the stock market. No one can predict the future and we can't say for sure how a particular investment will play out in the future. However, we can use past performance and probability to simulate what might happen in the future. This problem applies this idea to create a small-scale Monte Carlo stock market simulation."
