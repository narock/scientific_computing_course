    "4.) The Titanic had multiple fair classes. This is analogous to first class, business class, and economy tickets today. Create a scatter plot showing the fair paid by age. If you've imported matplotlib as plt, then a scatter plot is done by plt.scatter(x,y). Within the titanic dataset, the columns to use are 'Age' and 'Fare'. Place age on the x-axis and fare on the y-axis. Label each axis and set a title. (4 points)"

    "6.) Create to separate histograms within one visualization window - what matplotlib calls a subplot. The top panel should be a histogram of women fares and the bottom panel a histogram of men fares. Matplotlib's hist function has an option input 'bins' that we can use to set the size of the bins in our histogram. From the scatter plots above we can see that the highest paid fare is jus over 500. Let's use this information to have the histogram bins range from 0 to 550 and each bin have a width of 10. We can do this using numpy's arange function: binVal = np.arange(0,550,10) and then pass this to hist() as: plt.hist(data, bins=binVal) (4 points)"
